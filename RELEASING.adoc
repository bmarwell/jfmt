= Releasing jfmt
:toc: macro

This document describes the release process for jfmt, including both early-access (pre-release) builds and official releases.

toc::[]

== Overview

jfmt uses https://jreleaser.org/[JReleaser] to automate the release process.
There are two types of releases:

* **Early Access builds**: Automated pre-releases from the `main` branch
* **Official releases**: Tagged releases created manually

Both processes build native binaries for multiple platforms:

* Linux x86_64 (static binary with musl)
* macOS x86_64 (Intel)
* macOS aarch64 (Apple Silicon)
* Windows x86_64

== Early Access Builds (Automated)

Early access builds are automatically created on every push to the `main` branch.

=== How it Works

1. When code is pushed to `main`, the `.github/workflows/early-access.yml` workflow is triggered
2. The workflow calls `.github/workflows/build-native.yml` to build native binaries for all platforms
3. Build artifacts are collected from all platform builds
4. JReleaser creates a pre-release on GitHub with all artifacts attached

=== What Gets Built

The `build-native.yml` workflow builds:

* A static native binary for each platform
* Distribution archives (`.zip` and `.tar.gz`) containing:
  - The native executable
  - Bash completion scripts
  - Man pages
  - License files
  - Third-party license information

=== Viewing Early Access Builds

Early access builds appear as pre-releases on the https://github.com/bmarwell/jfmt/releases[GitHub Releases page].
They are tagged with a version like `early-access` and are marked as pre-releases.

== Official Releases

Official releases are created manually by project maintainers.

=== Prerequisites

Before creating a release, ensure:

1. All tests pass on the `main` branch
2. The changelog is up to date
3. You have write access to the repository
4. You have the `GH_PAT` secret configured (for maintainers)

=== Release Process

The release process will be documented when the release workflow is set up.
For now, early access builds are the primary distribution method.

[NOTE]
====
The release workflow template is available at: https://github.com/mthmulders/mcs/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml

This will be adapted in a future issue.

== Technical Details

=== JReleaser Configuration

The JReleaser configuration is split between two files:

* `jreleaser.yml`: Main configuration file at the repository root
  - Project metadata (name, description, license)
  - Release configuration (GitHub settings)
  - Distribution definitions (artifacts to release)

* `cli/pom.xml`: Maven-specific assembly configuration
  - JReleaser Maven plugin execution
  - Java archive assembly definition
  - File sets for documentation and completions

=== Maven Goals

The release process uses the following Maven goals:

* `jreleaser:assemble`: Creates distribution archives from build artifacts
  - Executed during the `package` phase in the `cli` module
  - Bundles the JAR with dependencies, docs, and scripts

* `jreleaser:full-release`: Performs a complete release
  - Creates/updates GitHub release
  - Uploads all distribution artifacts
  - Generates changelog from conventional commits
  - Executed in the early-access workflow's release job

[TIP]
====
To test the assembly locally without releasing:

[source,console]
----
./mvnw clean package -Prelease
----

This will create distributions in `cli/target/jreleaser/assemble/`.
====

=== Workflow Architecture

The workflow architecture uses GitHub Actions' reusable workflow feature:

[source]
----
early-access.yml
  ├─ calls: build-native.yml (builds on all platforms)
  │    ├─ build-linux-x64-musl
  │    └─ build-others (matrix: macOS x64, macOS aarch64, Windows x64)
  └─ release job (collects artifacts, runs jreleaser:full-release)
----

This design:

* Keeps build logic in one place (`build-native.yml`)
* Allows testing native builds independently
* Shares secrets securely using `secrets: inherit`
* Enables parallel builds across platforms

=== Artifact Locations

After a successful build, artifacts are available in several locations:

* **GitHub Actions artifacts**: Temporary storage during workflow runs
  - `artifacts-ubuntu-latest`: Linux binaries
  - `artifacts-macos-13`: macOS Intel binaries
  - `artifacts-macos-14`: macOS ARM binaries
  - `artifacts-windows-2022`: Windows binaries

* **GitHub Releases**: Permanent storage for released artifacts
  - Early access: https://github.com/bmarwell/jfmt/releases/tag/early-access
  - Tagged releases: `https://github.com/bmarwell/jfmt/releases/tag/v{version}`

=== Secrets Required

The following secrets must be configured in the repository (for maintainers):

* `GH_PAT`: GitHub Personal Access Token with repo and packages permissions
  - Used by JReleaser to create releases and upload artifacts

* `MUSL_TOOLCHAIN_LOCATION`: URL to musl toolchain download location
* `MUSL_TOOLCHAIN_USER`: Username for musl toolchain authentication
* `MUSL_TOOLCHAIN_PASS`: Password for musl toolchain authentication

== Troubleshooting

=== Build Failures

If the early access build fails:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for the failing job
2. Look for errors in the build output
3. Common issues:
   - Compilation errors: Fix the code and push again
   - Test failures: Fix the tests or investigate test flakiness
   - Native image build failures: Check GraalVM compatibility

=== Release Failures

If JReleaser fails to create a release:

1. Check the `jreleaser-release-output` artifact for detailed logs
2. Common issues:
   - Missing artifacts: Ensure all platform builds completed successfully
   - GitHub API errors: Check `GH_PAT` secret is valid and has required permissions
   - Configuration errors: Validate `jreleaser.yml` syntax

=== Testing Locally

To test the native build locally:

[source,console]
----
# Build native image for your platform
./mvnw clean package -Pnative

# Test the native binary
./cli/target/jfmt-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT --help
----

To test JReleaser configuration without releasing:

[source,console]
----
# Dry-run to check configuration
./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:config

# Assemble distributions without releasing
./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:assemble
----

== Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the release process:

* Add package manager integrations (Homebrew, Chocolatey, Scoop, SDKMAN)
* Set up Docker image releases
* Add social media announcements (Mastodon, Bluesky)
* Implement automated changelog generation
* Add release notes templates
