# Organize Import Order
# Default import-order profile for jdtfmt.
#
# How this file is interpreted internally by jdtfmt:
# - Keys are consecutive integers starting from 0; their numeric order defines the group order.
# - Values are tokens matched against fully qualified names (FQNs) of import declarations.
#   ? "#" denotes the group for ALL static imports (regardless of package).
#   ? An empty value "" denotes the catch-all group for remaining NON-STATIC imports that did not
#     match any other explicit non-empty token. It collects leftovers at its configured position.
#   ? Any other non-empty token T (e.g., "java", "org", "com.example") matches NON-STATIC imports whose
#     FQN starts with T (prefix match).
# - Only one "#" group is allowed. If it is omitted but static imports exist, jdtfmt appends a static
#   group at the end to ensure static imports are grouped deterministically.
# - If the empty token "" is omitted, jdtfmt appends a trailing leftovers group at the end when needed.
# - Within each group, imports are sorted lexicographically by fully qualified name. Exactly one blank
#   line is emitted between non-empty groups.
# - Fallback behavior (no properties found): jdtfmt behaves as if the order were 0=#, 1=, 2=java ? i.e.,
#   static imports first, then non-static non-java imports, then non-static java.* imports.
#
# Effective default order used by this profile:
#  0) static imports
#  1) non-static leftovers (non-java)
#  2) non-static java.*
